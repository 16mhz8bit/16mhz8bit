### Hi there 🖖,
I'm an avionics engineer and electronics engineering student, based in Italy 🇮🇹. <br>
I've been passionate about physics, electronics, astronomy, and space technologies since childhood. 
<br><br>
🌱 I recently built a radio telescope to study the Hydrogen Line and deepen my understanding of astrophysics.<br>
🌩️ I am finalizing a research project aboard the ISS investigating potential electromagnetic interference from storm clouds and its impact on onboard magnetometers.<br>
🔭 I am embarking on an exciting new engineering project in astronomy.<br>
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on exciting projects related to the Aerospace industry or new interesting technologies.<br>
